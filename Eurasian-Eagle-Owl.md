# Eurasian Eagle Owl

As its name suggests, the Eurasian Eagle Owl finds its habitat across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These highly-adaptive birds only need a nesting spot and a source of prey, meaning that some can take up residence in city parks, among other areas. This owl is most easily identified by its bright orange eyes and ear tufts.
