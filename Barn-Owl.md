Given its natural range, the Barn Owl is one of the most common owls in the United States. Despite this, most people have never seen one due to its stealthy nature and nocturnal behavior. Their roosts are often hidden, and like most owls, they hunt largely at night. While you might not have ever seen one, you may recognize them by their eerie screech, a bird call unique among owls.
